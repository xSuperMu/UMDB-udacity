# UMDB-udacity
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family.
In this project, I’ve built an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.
Ie will split the development of this app in two stages.
First, let's talk about stage 1.

## Popular Movies: Stage 1
Till this stage, the app can:
1) Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
2) Allow the user to change sort order via a setting:
      -> The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated.
3) Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
-> original title
-> movie poster image thumbnail
-> A plot synopsis
-> user rating
-> release date
